# Jahnavi Maddhuri: Actions Matrix
This project was originally started for the course, IDS 702: Data Engineering.
The purpose of this project is to setup a python project template where different python versions are tested through the build system, creating feedback loop every time I update my project. This can be useful in many different cases in the real world ie. when different systems using different python versions both access the same process. Under such cases, it's important to ensure that the developed code works in all required environments. 

In this case, I test three different python versions: 3.9, 3.10 and 3.11.
